Miro does Snack - Cookbook for triathlon athleetes today - Code Institute - Milestone project 03

The brief was to create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes.
The recipes are to be stored in a database which can be filtered by a user on the website using the categories.
It is a data-driven application, and the target audience is any user targeted towards stay at home or busy with work.

This application is for use by all as a stay at home athleetes who are busy with study, work, school runs,
extra curricular activities, coming up with quick meals before and after workout.
I designed the site so that users can share recipes and rate them accordingly.
